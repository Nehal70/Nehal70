## 💡 Featured Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on:

### [Board](https://yellow-bush-003f1130f.2.azurestaticapps.net/)
- ***Description:*** Digitised Softboards to create a collaborative digital environment using websockets so that softboards could have their google docs moment.
- **Highlights:** Used Azure and LLMs to store user PDFs, Images, Textual Posts and In-App AI conversations as posts on a softboard. Instant summarisation and instant post-driven context was enabled, allowing users to add image-based, text-based and file-based, as well as previous or other AI conversations as context to a new AI-conversation. Used React for the front-end to allow users to seamlessly add/edit/remove posts and generate AI insights in-app as well as summarise them and give conversations context regarding your softboard and its posts at any point in time.
