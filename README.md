### 💻 About Me
I specialize in the intersection of **Computer Architecture** and **System Software**. My work focuses on building high-performance hardware-software systems, with a particular interest in:

* **Chip Design & Verification:** RTL design (SystemVerilog/VHDL), UVM/Formal verification, and physical design workflows.
* **Operating Systems & Low-Level:** Kernel development, memory management, and hardware-software abstraction (C/C++, Linux).
* **Networking & Protocols:** Implementing hardware-level communication stacks (TCP/IP, UART, SPI, I2C) and high-speed interconnects.
* **Hardware-AI Acceleration:** Architecting custom silicon and FPGA accelerators for LLM and GNN workloads.
* **Embedded Systems:** Real-time signal analysis, bare-metal firmware, and FPGA-based DSP.
